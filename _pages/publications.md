I am Associate Professor of Sociology of Social Policy in the Department of Social Sciences at Humboldt University of Berlin and Senior Research Fellow at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). My research group on personal wealth accumulation in couples is funded by the Emmy Noether Programme of the German Research Foundation.

My main research interests are in social inequalities over and between life courses of individuals in divergent institutional contexts focusing on the family, wealth and employment. I mainly work with longitudinal survey data.
